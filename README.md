This repo contains a simple example of a runtime type error in TypeScript.  TypeScript's static typing helps catch many errors at compile time, but it doesn't guarantee complete runtime type safety. This example demonstrates a scenario where the code compiles without errors, but produces a runtime error due to a type mismatch.  The solution demonstrates how to use type guards to enhance type safety and prevent this runtime error.
